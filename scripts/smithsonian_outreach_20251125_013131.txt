Subject: Academic Licensing Inquiry: Traditional Thai Musical Instruments

Dear Smithsonian Folkways Licensing Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Dr. Sarah Chen, and I am conducting academic research on traditional Southeast Asian musical instruments with a focus on cultural preservation and machine learning applications.

**Research Context:**
I am developing an AI system for classifying traditional Thai musical instruments, specifically the khaen (bamboo mouth organ) and phin (lute) from the Isan region of Northeastern Thailand. This project emphasizes ethical cultural preservation and educational applications in collaboration with Thai cultural institutions.

**Specific Interest in Smithsonian Folkways Collections:**
I am interested in exploring academic licensing options for traditional Thai and Laotian instrument recordings from your collection, particularly:
- Khaen (bamboo mouth organ) performances
- Traditional Isan musical ensembles
- Solo phin performances
- Cultural context recordings with proper attribution

**Intended Academic Use:**
- Machine learning model training for instrument classification research
- Cultural preservation documentation and analysis
- Educational resources for Southeast Asian music studies
- Academic publication in peer-reviewed journals
- Community cultural conservation efforts in Thailand
- Non-commercial research and cultural heritage preservation

**Academic Licensing Requirements:**
I would like to understand:
1. Academic licensing options for research use of traditional music recordings
2. Licensing fees for non-commercial academic research
3. Attribution requirements for academic publications
4. Digital format availability and technical specifications
5. Usage restrictions for machine learning applications
6. Cultural sensitivity protocols for Thai traditional music

**Institutional Information:**
Digital Cultural Heritage Research Lab
Department of Computer Science & Cultural Studies
Research Focus: Ethical AI applications for cultural preservation
Contact: research@digitalheritage.org

**Timeline and Scope:**
- Project duration: 12-18 months
- Expected recordings needed: 20-50 traditional instrument samples
- Budget: Academic/non-commercial research rates
- Access needed: Digital files for analysis and research

**Ethical Considerations:**
Our project follows strict ethical guidelines including:
- Respect for cultural heritage and traditions
- Community consultation and benefit sharing
- Academic IRB approval for cultural research
- Proper attribution and cultural sensitivity
- Non-commercial use with cultural preservation focus

I would appreciate information about your academic licensing program and any available discounts for cultural preservation research. I am happy to provide additional documentation about our research protocol, institutional affiliation, or cultural sensitivity measures.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning about opportunities to access these important cultural recordings for academic research purposes.

With appreciation for your cultural preservation work,

Dr. Sarah Chen
