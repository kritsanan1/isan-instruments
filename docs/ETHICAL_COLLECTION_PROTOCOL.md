# Ethical Data Collection Protocol for Isan Musical Instruments

## 🌏 Cultural Context and Significance

Traditional Isan music represents centuries of cultural heritage from Northeastern Thailand and Laos. The instruments we study - **Phin (พิณ)** and **Khaen (แคน)** - are not merely musical tools but carriers of cultural identity, spiritual practices, and community cohesion. This protocol ensures that our data collection respects and preserves these cultural values.
